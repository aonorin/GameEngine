/**
 The `CameraNode` changes the view port of any nodes attached to it. Basically, rendering the positions, scale, etc., based on the `CameraNode`'s location in the scene.
 Essentially, this moves the `Renderable.modelView`s opposite to wherever it is.
 
 By default, every `Node` added to a `Scene` will have a camera property. 
 
 - note: This doesn't exaclty work like other nodes and I'm still trying to figure that out. If I don't, right now and forever?, only adding a `Camera` to a scene makes sense. 
         Adding a camera to anything else is kind of undefined.
